v1 - here, I backtest and simulate a simple algorthimic portfolio strategy with statistical methods

 aims:
- simulates stocks performance (from start to present day) of a customisable portfolio / benchmark 
- produces backlogged data in excel format, as well as factor regression results for statistical and factor investing inference / pratical insights
- produces visuals, rolling regressions and short term windows to test for mean reversion 
- optimises portfolio weightings into best performing based on drawdowns for each period
