v1 -Here, I implement algorthimic and statistical methods in a simple portfolio performance simulation.

 aims:
- simulates performance and overall results of stocks (from start to live, present day) of any defined portfolio / benchmark of choice.
- produces backlogs in excel format, and factor regression results for statisticl and factor investing inference / pratical insights
- produces visuals, rolling regressions and short term windows to test for mean reversion 
- optimises portfolio weightings into most efficient for each defined period 


v2 
- aims to create dashboard and graphical results, readily exported into excel for further analysis / quality check
- double checks against other historical data sources - aside from yfinance
- supports custom, excel report uploads in defined structure
- gives key statistics for risk
